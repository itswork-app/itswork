# AIVO BASELINE

## Philosophy

### 1. Determinism
Inputs + Logic = Exact Same Output. Sways in network, time, or random seeds must be isolated.

### 2. Policy-First
Logic is driven by declarative policy, not hardcoded conditionals.

### 3. Receipt Mindset
Everything is a "receipt". A run produces a static, verifiable artifact.
