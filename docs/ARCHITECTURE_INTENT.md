# ARCHITECTURE INTENT

## Conceptual Flow

1. **UI/Input**: User configures policy or provides usage data.
2. **Decision**: Engine compares Data vs Policy.
3. **Record**: Result (PASS/FAIL) is recorded as a static receipt.

*Note: This is a conceptual intent. Actual implementation details live in code.*
