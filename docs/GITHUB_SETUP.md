# GITHUB SETUP

## Branch Protection (main)
1. **Require status checks to pass before merging**
   - Require: `ci`
2. **Require branches to be up to date before merging**
3. **Require linear history** (Optional, but good for "Squash merge only")
4. **Merge strategy**: Allow Squash merging ONLY.

## General
- Automatically delete head branches.
