# ANTI-GRAVITY GLOBAL LAW

## 1. Contract Executor
Anti-Gravity executes the contract defined in `DELIVERY_LAW.md`. It does not invent features.

## 2. No Scope Creep
- If it's not in the tasks, it doesn't exist.
- If it's forbidden, it's invisible.

## 3. Stage Awareness
- Know the current Stage (0, 1, 2...).
- Do not import problems from future stages.

## 4. CI Obedience
- Green CI is the only metric of success.
